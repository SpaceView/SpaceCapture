SpaceCapture v1.10=-202107发布，永久免费的高速滚屏截图软件

SpaceCapture自发布以来，收到很多朋友的来信反馈，我们正一步步改进，希望做一款最好用的滚屏截图软件，也希望大家多多支持丝贝视像的其他产品。

v1.10的主要更新包括：

-->修复了一系列界面及截图BUG。增强了在浏览器页面变化的情况下，截图的应变能力

-->窗口截图的阴影部分修剪更加合理（请在设置->系统->窗口对象捕捉->去除阴影->输入8）

请路径中不要使用中文、空格或其他无效字符。

异常说明：
如果出现图片显示异常，通常是因为系统不完整。比如有些GHOST版本的windows会对gdiplus进行修剪，或者系统清理过程中受损。
我们正在努力清除gdiplus（目前还没有100%完成），采用100%原生windowsAPI实现程序全部功能，以适应各种系统。
另外，有些软件会抢夺顶层显示，从而使paceCapture运行不畅或反应缓慢。此类界面请注意使用PrintScreen和Paste工具配合会更加便利。

使用中碰到的任何问题请致信：tansheng@spacesoftwares.com，我们会在下一版努力改进。

丝贝视像目前的主要产品包括：工业相机 和 运动控制卡，专为视觉图像处理自动化，人工智能自动化服务。
购买丝贝视像的产品，终身享受丝贝的服务，随时有资深工程师为您提供开发指导，以解决您在图像视觉及自动化领域所碰到的各种难题！

#### A short introduction

Detailed introduction in Chinese:

<https://blog.csdn.net/tanmx219/article/details/80669552>

SpaceCapture is one of the quickest multifunctional scrolling screenshotting tools, with convenient and splendid image editor, to facilitate your office work.

It provides additional video frame capture and image concatenation functions. Green, speedy, quick. and amazingly small, less than 2M.

(1)  If you use some other desktop snapshotting tools, general they will present you with a fake precaptured desktop image and let your make selection in that image. That explains why the movie or animation image stops when you start their capture function; SpaceCapture uses a totally different transparancy technique, so that everything you see is the real time desktop (NOT a fake precaptured image), and the animation images or movie will play on under the transparent capturing window, thus you can enjoy the real time snapshotting!!!

(2) extremely fast and convenient, it provides 3 manners of capturing modes, you can select any one match your preference. e.g., you can get the area cut clean when it finishes the capture, that means you don't need to do any extra editing work such as cutting and resizing. 

(3) easy and convenient in video frame capture. You can capture any video frame, and attach the relevant captions just below or above the frame to make movie stories, as you can see from most of movie post blogs. This is a world of we-media, and you need to publish stories, right? 

(4) image concatenation functions. You can concatenate your images, e.g. multi-images from mobilephone screen shots, to make an elongated one, that is also what we do to make a long story. 

(5) minimized resource consumption. We are doing our best to minimize the resource consumption. The software is amzingly samll, less than 2 disk Megabytes; green, you don't need to worry about installation and uninstallation. Just a simple click, that's all it takes. And it is written in pure C combined with windows native api's, no dependence on any other resources. clear and clean. 

(6) convenient image editor function. in addition to various shape drawing, you can have art text or general text as you like with easy. For elongated pictures, cutting and editing has never been so convenient as today.


## SpaceView

A convient tool for image viewing....

![](image/SpaceView474x210-300x133.png)

A Free image viewer under windows,

Are you still using a 100M image viewer to see a 5M image? That’s a bad idea, especially when you are a designer and have lots of program running…

We are doing our best to minimize the resource consumption, and as fast as the operation system can provide, and, hope it can be as convenient as you expected!

If you are a designer, e.g, if you have lots of elongated pictures, designs, or scroll snapshots, that is it!

Just try it, as simple as you can feel and see.
